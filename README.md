![CI Build Status](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

<b>Azahar</b> is an open-source 3DS emulator project based Citra.

It was created from the merging of PabloMK7's Citra fork and the Lime3DS project, both of which emerged shortly after Citra was taken down.

The goal of this project is to be the de-facto platform for future development.

> [!NOTE]
> Azahar has not fully released yet. For this reason, there are no compiled binaries available for download.
> 
> It is recommended that only developers and early adopters should use the emulator until our first stable release.
>
> Here be dragons.

# How can I contribute?

### Pull requests

If you want to implement a change and have the technical capability to do so, we would be happy to accept your contributions.

If you are contributing a new feature, it is highly suggested that you first make a Feature Request issue to discuss the addition before writing any code. This is to ensure that your time isn't wasted working on a feature which isn't deemed appropriate for the project.

After creating a pull request, please don't repeatedly merge `master` into your branch. A maintainer will update the branch for you if/ when it is appropriate to do so.

### Language translations

Additionally, we are accepting language translations on [Transifex](https://app.transifex.com/azahar/azahar). If you know a non-english language listed on our Transifex page, please feel free to contribute.

> [!NOTE]
> We are not currently accepting new languages for translation. Please do not request for new languages or language variants to be added.

### Compatibility reports

Even if you don't wish to contribute code or translations, you can help the project by reporting game compatibility data to our compatibility list.

To do so, simply read https://github.com/azahar-emu/compatibility-list/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md and follow the instructions.

Contributing compatibility data helps more accurately reflect the current capabilities of the emulator, so it would be highly appreciated if you could go through the reporting process after completing a game.
